# Python Project

## Steps :

Inside the local git repository, I created a directory for each Python Challenge. I used folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.

Inside of each folder I've added the following:


-A new file called main.py. This is the main script to run for each analysis.

-A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files I've used. 

-An "analysis" folder that contains my text file that has the results from my analysis.
