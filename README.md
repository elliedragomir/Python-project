# python-challenge
# Steps :
Created a new repository for this project called python-challenge

Cloned the new repository

Inside the local git repository, created a directory for each Python Challenge. Used folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.

Inside of each folder I've added the following:


-A new file called main.py. This is the main script to run for each analysis.

-A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files I've used. 

-An "analysis" folder that contains my text file that has the results from my analysis.


Pushed the above changes to GitLab.
